Project
We propose the development of a Weather Web App that provides users with real-time weather information based on their location or a specified location. The app will utilize a reliable weather API to fetch and display accurate weather data, offering users a convenient way to access current weather conditions, forecasts, and additional relevant information. Users may personalize their experience in the app to tailor it to their needs.
Jira will be used to push daily updates as well as the most recently developed code. It will also assist us in keeping track of the sprint cycles. GitHub will be used to show our daily and weekly meetings and timetable showing the sprints.

Meetings
Daily updates 9 am
Weekly meetings, Tuesdays from 3-4:30 pm
These meetings are done on a weekly basis to keep the team on track, giving opportunities for bug reports, and to revise the requirements if needed.
